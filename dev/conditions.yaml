- n should range from zero to number of options
- don't render n+1 as value
- exactly should show all values
- more than should show values[:-1]
- less than should show values[1:]
- 'at least' is the same as 'more than' but includes current strike
- so 'at least' should show values[1:-1]
- 'at most' is the same as 'less than' but includes current strike
- so 'at most' should show values[1:-1]
